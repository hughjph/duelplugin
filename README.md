# duelplugin

A duel plugin for a spigot vanilla server<br>

You will have to enter the coordinates of the starting points of the players in the source code then build it<br>



To change the locations where duels can happen go to: <br>
<br>
_**DuelPluginPackage/duelPlugin/coordinates.json**_
<br><br>
And add the locations for each spawn, player one locations should be titled x1, y1 and z1, Player 2 locations should be titled x2, y2 and z2.<br>
<br>
 **This plugin has not been made for a big server so your mileage may vary when using it with more than 20 people**
