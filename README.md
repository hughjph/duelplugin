# duelplugin

A duel plugin for a spigot vanilla server<br>

You will have to enter the coordinates of the starting points of the players in the source code then build it<br>

The coordinates for the starting point are in the file duelPlayer.java at line 139 and 140<br>

It is not meant for a big server
